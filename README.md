# GenericsLibrary
Generic doubly linked list and binary heap. work in progress

the heap and list data structures accept void * generic pointers to hold data. 
they both accept a function pointer to delete the data for entries. 

no memory leaks!

currently binary heap and linked list is implemented. I am working on AVL trees right now
